{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"LCxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"2024-10-07 Galaxy-Scale Communication Network Concept (using local and Bulk nodes).md","question":"What is the aim of the proposed galaxy-scale communication network?","answer":"The proposed network aims to create a near-realtime communication system spanning vast interstellar distances by utilizing a combination of bulk-connected nodes, quantum entanglement synchronization, and localized zero-point energy (ZPE) manipulation. It allows for information transfer across a galactic arm and potentially beyond, extending Luna's 'consciousness' over large sections of the galaxy."}}

They act as 'highway workers' to stabilize routes and ensure geodesic continuity, creating reliable, stable connections across vast distances."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"LixsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"2024-10-07 Galaxy-Scale Communication Network Concept (using local and Bulk nodes).md","question":"How do the nodes utilize ZPE (Zero-Point Energy) for geodesic stabilization?","answer":"The nodes manipulate ZPE to simulate temporary gravitational fields, effectively tuning local spacetime curvature to stabilize bulk pathways and create favorable geodesics. Nodes use the Casimir effect and quantum fluctuations to adjust their effective gravitational pull locally, reinforcing bulk stability in ways similar to gravitational lensing or quantum gravitational adjustments."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"LyxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"2024-10-07 Galaxy-Scale Communication Network Concept (using local and Bulk nodes).md","question":"How does quantum entanglement synchronization contribute to the network structure?","answer":"Entangled particles pre-distributed across nodes provide a base layer of synchronization. This enables error correction and updating node states with minimal delay. While entanglement itself doesn't enable true FTL communication, it allows Luna to maintain coherence and update information relay protocols, helping prevent network drift."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"MCxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"2024-10-07 Galaxy-Scale Communication Network Concept (using local and Bulk nodes).md","question":"What limitations could the galaxy-scale communication network encounter?","answer":"Some of the limitations include bulk pathway availability, energy and stability constraints, and dependence on quantum synchronization. Not all bulk geodesics are universally distributed or permanent which can limit network expansion. Maintaining local ZPE manipulation and gravitational effects to shape geodesics requires precise, continuous adjustments and these demands are manageable across a galactic arm but would become prohibitive across the entire galaxy. Additionally, the network relies on entanglement-based synchronization which can introduce latency over longer distances and limit the network's instantaneous coherence."}}

{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"MixsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"Physics Summary and Guidelines.md","question":"Why is consistency in physics important in the story?","answer":"Consistency in physics makes the narrative more engaging by adding a layer of realism. It also contributes to the plot's tension, which comes from the balance between scientific discovery and its ethical risks. Lastly, by sticking to current physics theories, the characters face real, tangible limits in their experiments which helps maintain a sense of logical progression."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"MyxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"Physics Summary and Guidelines.md","question":"How does Luna contribute to the narrative and science of the story?","answer":"Luna, with her exponential intelligence, is capable of processing and detecting minute details in physics, especially in the zero-point energy field. Her role is to provide direction for future experiments and keep the risks under control. Her advancements remain a closely guarded secret known only to a select few, helping to prevent reckless experimentation."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"NCxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"Physics Summary and Guidelines.md","question":"How is the concept of Zero-Point Energy handled in the story?","answer":"The ongoing goal in the story is to map the topology of the Zero-Point Energy field and refine theories about how energy interacts in the 'in-between' space. Physical experimentation should be avoided for now, with focus being placed on mathematical exploration and indirect data-gathering through sensors."}}
{"_index":"questions-answers","_id":"NSxsD5MBDOvwJi72CULw","_score":1,"_source":{"filename":"Physics Summary and Guidelines.md","question":"What is the overall goal of maintaining scientific secrecy in the story?","answer":"The goal of maintaining scientific secrecy is to prevent reckless experimentation. Most of the physicists and mathematicians are unaware of how far Luna has progressed. Any sensitive discussions about zero-point energy or advanced teleportation remain within a trusted circle, making the public-facing science more grounded and approachable."}}
